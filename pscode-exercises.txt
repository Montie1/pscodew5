// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

BEGIN
INPUT the first number num1
INPUT the second number num2
Add num1 and num2 together and called sum
Output the "sum"
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

BEGIN
INPUT a value and variable
If num1 mod 2 equals 0:
    OUTPUT "Even"
Else:
    OUTPUT "Odd"
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
Begin
INPUT "num1"
INPUT "num2"
INPUT "num3" 
INPUT "num4"
INPUT "num5"
OUTPUT "num1", "num2", "num3", "num4", and "num5"
END   

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
BEGIN
INPUT five variables num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5 and give values 
ADD the values of num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5 together and sum
Divide % the sum by 5 
OUTPUT "average"
End

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
BEGIN
FOR "num1", "num2", "num3", "num4", and "num5"
ENTER "num1"
ENTER "num2"
ENTER "num3"
ENTER "num4"
ENTER "num5"
NEXT find the values of "num1", "num2", "num3", "num4", and "num5" for the smallest and largest numbers
PRINT the "smallest and largest of the numbers"
END

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
